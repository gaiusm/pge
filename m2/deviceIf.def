(*
   glyphLine - draw a line between:  start and end of, thick, thickness and colour, c.
*)

PROCEDURE glyphLine (start, end: Point; thick: Fract; c: Colour) ;


(*
   glyphPolygon - draw a polygon given n absolute points.
                  If fill then it is filled with colour, c, else it is drawn with
                  thickness in outline using colour, c.
*)

PROCEDURE glyphPolygon (n: CARDINAL; p: ARRAY OF Point; fill: BOOLEAN; thick: Fract; c: Colour) ;


(*
   glyphCircle - draw a circle at point, pos.  If fill then it is filled by colour, c,
                 otherwise it is drawn in outline with a thickness, thick, in colour, c.
*)

(*
   flipBuffer - renders the current buffer and then sets up a new buffer to be
                populated by new glyphs.
*)

PROCEDURE flipBuffer ;


(*
   frameNote - emit a note to indicate a new frame has commenced.

(*
   writeTime - writes the delay, t, to the frame buffer (if t > 0.0).

   defineColour - defines a colour by: r, g, b.  The fracts
                  are given to the colour and a colour index
                  is returned.  Colours live for ever and are
                  never freed.
